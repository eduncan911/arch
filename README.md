# Setup Arch Linux

I have installed Arch far too many times than I can remember for many years.  I
highly prefer Arch on everything including most of my embedded devices
(Raspberry Pi, UP Board, UP Squared) of which I have a few dozen in the
collection.  

To help speed up the process, this repository holds a set of commands to
self-configure devices.

## DISCLAIMER

You do not want to use this repo.  You want to follow The Arch Way and install
ArchLinux following the extremely methodical and accurate Arch Wiki:

https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide

Only after you've install Arch a few dozen times across different embedded, ARM
and PC devices will you have the knowledge of the subtle differences between 
these platforms, storage and network configurations and why these files in this
repo are ordered the way they are.

## They were built for my Homelab

These scripts auto-config my Arch systems using my personal preferences.  It is
highly likely you will have slightly different preferences.

## Fork Me

Feel free to fork it and tweak the settings to your taste.
